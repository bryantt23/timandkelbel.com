      %p I met Kelly in the summer of 2010. We became great friends, because I felt so comfortable around her. There are people who’s presence makes the day better, and the activity that much funner; that's Kelly. She’s intelligent, fun, caring, self-sacrificing, and her wit is always one step ahead of you. Just when you think you have her figured out, she’ll surprise you by rapping a song word-for-word. There is no one like her, and I can’t believe I have the amazing honor of marrying her, sharing my life with her, and trying to make her happy.
